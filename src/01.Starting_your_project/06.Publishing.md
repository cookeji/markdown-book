# Publishing to Pages

These are instructions for GitLab, which I now prefer over GitHub.  By default
when you publish to `pages` GitLab, the URL will be  
<!-- markdownlint-disable -->
**http://&#60;username&#62;.gitlab.io/&#60;repository&#62;/**
<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

For this repository, the pages location is
<https://jimcooke.gitlab.io/markdown-book/>

## GitLab CI/CD

Our demo deployment is controlled by GitLab CI/CD.  Our repository ignores the `public` folder in `.gitignore`.
Instead, the following CI pipeline has been defined in the repository root in file '.gitignore`.  Basically it just:

* Starts an *mdbook* container from docker hub
* Installs markdownlint
* Builds the summary file
* Lint-checks the document
* Builds the HTML document
* Publishes the resulting artefact to pages

```bash
image: hrektts/mdbook:latest

pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
  - apt-get update
  - apt-get -y install curl
  - curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
  - apt-get -y install -y nodejs
  - apt-get -y install -y npm
  - npm install -g markdownlint-cli
  - ./make_summary.sh
  - markdownlint -c options.config src
  - mdbook build --dest-dir public
  artifacts:
    paths:
    - public
  only:
  - master
```

## Publising to Second Location

Just to prove how versatile we can be with git, I set up a second location to publish
the material to, this time on GitHub pages.  I created a new repository with my own account
called <https://github.com/cookeji/markdown-book>.  In the repository settings, I went to
the `GitHub Pages` section and chose &#91;master branch /docs folder&#93; as the source.
My `Makefile` will publish the HTML code to the `/docs` folder.  So, to publish from there
I just set up a secondary remote and push to there as follows:

```bash
git remote add secondary1 https://github.com/cookeji/markdown-book
make
make publish
git add -A
git commit -m "Publish new version of the book"
git push origin master         # Normal push to primary
git push -f secondary1 master  # Push to secondary
```

This works and can be seen at <https://cookeji.github.io/markdown-book/>
