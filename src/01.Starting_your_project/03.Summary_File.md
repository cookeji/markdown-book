# Summary File Generation

The precursor to rendering your documents nicely in HTML using mdbook is
to have the SUMMRY.md file generated.  If you have structured your files
and documents as per the rules in this guide, you just need to execute the
`make_summary.sh` script at the root of this project.  It may well throw
errors if you have:

* Not started your `*.md` document with a Header-1 `# Title` line
* Any of your file or directory names contain spaces
* Any directory in your tree is missing a `HEADER.md` file

If it works properly, it will look like this

```bash
./make_summary.sh
src/SUMMARY.md built successfully!
```
