# Building the Book

This is the bit where we generate the nice static HTML file that can be published
as a book.  When we build for production CI/CD, I use a docker container called
**hrektts/mdbook**.

**To emphasise again, it is better to build and test locally before one commits**, hence
I recommend installing rust's mdbook locally on your machine.  The repository for
the Rust code is <https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/mdBook/cli/index.html> but it
is easier just to install from their released binaries at  
<https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/mdBook/releases>

## Build for Publishing

By default, mdbook will build the HTML into a directory called `book`.  I change
this to `public` so I can publish on git pages.  The build command I use from the
root of the repository is:

```bash
mdbook build --dest-dir public
```

## Serving Locally

mdbook can also serve your pages locally.  To do this, execute the following command
from the root of your repository:

```bash
mdbook serve --dest-dir public
```

Then view your book at <http://localhost:3000>
