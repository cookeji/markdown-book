# Initialise New Repository

## Clone This Repository

You need to clone this repository and set up your new documentation
repository.  Do this from your command line.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/jimcooke/markdown-book.git
BOOKNAME="mybook"  # Choose your own name here
mv markdown-book "${BOOKNAME}"
cd "${BOOKNAME}"
rm -rf .git      # Remove existing git repository details
git init         # Create a new git repository
```

## Set Up Book Metadata

In the root directory, edit the file *book.toml* and change the following
section to start off with

```bash
title = "<Put your own title here>"
description = "<Put your own brief description here>"
authors = ["<author names, quote-delimited, comma-separated>"]
language = "en"
```

## Git Prerequisites

This is not a git tutorial, so performing a basic tutorial is recommended.  
You should also have a remote git server account that you can push to
(like GitLab.com or GitHub.com).  
Just as a quick check, you can run the following commands to see if you're all
set locally.

```bash
# Check your config
git config --global --list

# Update config if necessary
git config --global user.name "YOUR_USERNAME"
git config --global user.email "your_email_address@example.com"
```

## Initial Commit

Before you go too far, make your inital commit and set up your remote repository
server.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial Commit"
git remote add origin <git repository path, eg. https://gitlab.com/jimcooke/mybook.git>
git push origin master
```
