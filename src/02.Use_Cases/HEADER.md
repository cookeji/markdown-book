# Markdown Doco Use Cases

Markdown documentation is a useful tool to have at your disposal.  It is particularly suited for
documenting existing git repositories as it is a logical place to keep your documentation ... right
alongside your code.

## Advantages over Confluence

* Able to keep local copies on your own workstation and publish to multiple sites
* Can serve the pages locally from your PC
* If implemented properly, consistent formatting and lint checking

## Disadvantages with Confluence

* No WYSIWYG editor.  There is a learning curve
* Generally git markdown more restrictive access to modify code, but easy to make it world-readable in pages
