# Markdown Doco Use Cases

Markdown documentation is a useful tool to have at your disposal.  It is particularly suited for
documenting existing git repositories as it is a logical place to keep your documentation ... right
alongside your code.

## Advantages versus Confluence

* Able to keep local copies on your own workstation and publish to multiple sites
* Can serve the pages locally from your PC, ie.  it is there when you are offline if you have a copy
* If implemented properly, consistent formatting and lint checking
* Version control is much more robust and git framework lends itself to multi-person collaboration
* Very easy to pass source to PDF generators for printing.  Can easily generate beautiful printed documents

## Disadvantages versus Confluence

* No WYSIWYG editor.  There is a learning curve
* Generally git markdown more restrictive access to modify code, but easy to make it world-readable in pages
* No integration with Jira and other Atlassian tools
