# Block Quotes

To create a blockquote, add a &#62; in front of a paragraph.
Block quotes can contain multiple paragraphs. Add a &#62; on the blank lines between
the paragraphs.

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements. Not all elements
can be used, you will need to experiment to see which ones work.

```markdown
> This is the source for a block quote
```

> This is what the block quote looks like
>
> This is a line after a blank line

Block quotes can be nested with multiple &#62;&#62; characters

> This is the outer block
>> This is an inner block
> Back to the outer block
