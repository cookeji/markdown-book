# Lists

## Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The
numbers donâ€™t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the
number one.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
```

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+)
in front of line items.  Indent one or more items to create a nested list.

```markdown
* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item
```

* First item
* Second item
* Third item
* Fourth item

## List Elements

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list,
indent the element four spaces or one tab.  The following elements work within
a list:

* Paragraphs
* Blockquotes
* Code Blocks
* Images
