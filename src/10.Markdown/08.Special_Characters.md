# Special Characters

There are special characters like square brackets that are interpreted as markdown
syntax and need to be escaped properly.  I tend to steer away from using escape
characters as it quickly becomes doubly-confusing if you have to escape the escape
character itself, or other edge cases you may encounter.  Instead, I prefer to use
the decimal ascii codes and get finished with it.

Here are some common ones

| Character | Markdown Ascii | Name |
|---|---:|---|
| TAB | `&#9;` | Tab |
| LF (linefeed) | `&#10;` | Line feed |
| CR (carriage return) | `&#13;` | Carriage return |
| &#124; | `&#124;` | Pipe or vertical bar |
| &#34; | `&#34;` | double-quote |
| &#39; | `&#39;` | single-quote |
| &#60; | `&#60;` | left angle-bracket |
| &#62; | `&#62;` | right angle-bracket |
| &#64; | `&#64;` | at |
| &#91; | `&#91;` | left square-bracket |
| &#93; | `&#93;` | right square-bracket |
| &#94; | `&#94;` | caret |
| &#96; | `&#96;` | backtick |
| &#123; | `&#123;` | left curly-brace |
| &#125; | `&#125;` | right curly-brace |
| &#126; | `&#126;` | tilde |
