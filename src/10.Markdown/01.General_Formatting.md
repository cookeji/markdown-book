## Paragraphs

You should not indent paragraphs with spaces or tabs.

## Line Breaks

To create a line break (like on this example line), you  
end the line with 2 or more spaces.

## Font Formatting

### Bold Text

Text is rendered as bold by being escaped by double-asterisks or double-underscores

```markdown
This will be rendered as **bold** text
This will also be rendered as __bold__ text
```

### Italic Text

Text is rendered as italic by being escaped by single-asterisks or single-underscores

```markdown
This will be rendered as *italic* text
This will also be rendered as _italic_ text
```

### Bold Italic Text

Text is rendered as bold and italic by being escaped by triple-asterisks or triple-underscores

```markdown
This will be rendered as ***bold italic*** text
This will also be rendered as ___bold italic___ text
```

## Horizontal Lines

To create a horizontal rule, use three or more asterisks (***), dashes (---), or
underscores (___) on a line by themselves.
