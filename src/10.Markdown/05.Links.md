# Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go])
and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (<https://duckduckgo.com>)).

```markdown
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).
```

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com).

## Link Titles

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the
user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL.

```markdown
My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com "For privacy").
```

My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com
"The best search engine for privacy").

## URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets.

``` markdown
<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>
```

<https://www.markdownguide.org>
<fake@example.com>

## Formatting Links

You can format links as bold or italic in the same way as normal text.
