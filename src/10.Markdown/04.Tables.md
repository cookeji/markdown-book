# Tables

Tables are done with simple piping notation to denote columns.  Colons are used to right-align, left-align or centre-align
columns.  There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell. The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.  

```markdown
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
```

You can use markdown formatting inside tables as follows

```markdown
Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```
